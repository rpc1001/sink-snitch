Goals for this week:

Find a good dataset (open images dish classes?)
Camera software
Train a basic model on the dataset (Rafa, Dylan)
WHEN model successful, work on logic to detect dish going into sink

Frontend design, barebones. (Max, Emerson)
Timestamp and photo. 
Potentially video clips lowlights lol 
Research clipping Videos from frontend (GARMIN) (DQL aka SQL)
Backend (Linden, Hugo, Owen)
input: (image, dish, name)
logic: stores in database, sends notifications
Research (Dylan, Kemma, DQL)
making our own facial recognition dataset 
how we could have two cameras going
maybe set bounding box on sink in opencv and detect if dishes go in and out


Week after:

Test model on phone camera software (get them hooked up)

Detect how long the dish was left, find the exact moment and save the video 

Trigger events on detections (hella logic)

Facial recog?





Week after: 







Video Clipping (dql)

Record/capture short clips when AI detects someone putting dishes into the sink using a live camera feed that is streamed from an iphone using an app like iVCam

Findings:
Feasible on the frontend
If the frontend app is a web app we can use the browser’s built-in MediaRecorder API to record from a live camera
No backend video processing is required

Simple Workflow:
Camera feed
iVCam or other application to stream iPhone camera to laptop
Laptop treats it as a normal webcam
Frontend
Browser keeps a rolling buffer of the live stream using MediaRecorder
AI
When it detects a dish entering the sink region, it triggers an event
Clipping
When AI triggers, export recent buffered footage as a short video clip (e.g. 10 seconds before and after event)
(optional) Capture a still frame at the same timestamp for notification
Upload & storage
Send the clip/photo to the backend for storage and notification


Facial recognition dataset
Each housemate: around 30-50 photos in kitchen lighting
Different angles, expressions, distance, with/without glasses
Libraries like face_recognition can convert photos into "face embeddings" (128-number vectors that represent each face) and find matches

Two camera setup
Plug in two USB webcams for overhead and side angle
Finding the right physical mounting positions and make sure both have good lighting
Open both cameras simultaneously using cv2.VideoCapture(0) and cv2.VideoCapture(1)
Each camera gets an ID number (0, 1, 2, etc.)
